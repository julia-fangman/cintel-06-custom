## Project Title: Custom Interactive Dashboard for Titanic Dataset
### Julia Fangman

#### Objective:
This project aims to create a custom interactive dashboard using PyShiny, showcasing insights and visualizations derived from the Titanic dataset. The dashboard will provide users with an engaging way to explore the data, analyze trends, and interactively filter information.

#### Filter Controls:
Users can filter passengers by age, sex, and ticket class.
The dashboard provides intuitive controls for selecting filter criteria, enabling users to customize their data views.

#### About The Titanic Dashboard:
A dedicated sidebar section provides an introduction to the dashboard.
Users are welcomed with a brief overview of the dashboard's purpose and functionality.
Instructions encourage users to explore insights and interact with the provided filter controls.

#### Interactive Elements:
Input sliders for age allow users to specify age ranges for filtering passengers.
Checkbox groups for sex and ticket class enable users to select multiple options for filtering.

#### GitHub Links:
Convenient links to the GitHub source code and repository are provided within the sidebar.
Users can easily access the source code for the dashboard or visit the repository for additional information.

#### Dashboard Statistics:
Number of Passengers: Displays the total number of passengers in the filtered dataset.
Average Age: Shows the average age of passengers within the filtered dataset.
Average Fare: Indicates the average fare paid by passengers in the filtered dataset.

#### Visualizations:
Age and Fare Scatterplot: Visualizes the relationship between passenger age and fare, segmented by ticket class.
Passenger Data Grid: Presents detailed information about passengers, including class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses, number of parents/children, and fare.

#### Data Filtering:
Utilizes reactive calculations to dynamically filter the Titanic dataset based on user input.
Filters are applied to the dataset to reflect user-selected criteria for age, sex, and ticket class.

#### Conclusion:
The Titanic Dashboard offers users an interactive and informative platform for exploring the Titanic dataset. With intuitive filter controls, insightful statistics, and visualizations, users can gain valuable insights into the demographics and characteristics of Titanic passengers. The dashboard provides a user-friendly experience for both casual users and data enthusiasts alike, making it a valuable addition to any data science portfolio.
